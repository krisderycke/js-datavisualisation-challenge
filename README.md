# Data visualization

In this excercise i had to get all the data from an HTML table and use that data to present charts. Only using JavaScript and without editing the HTML. You can find my results [here](https://krisderycke.github.io/js-datavisualisation-challenge/).

## How did i do this?

First i searched the tables with the corresponding data and used several For-loops in order to get the proper data in Arrays.

## What have i learned?

Exctracting a ton of information using nothing but JavaScript Loops.

## Conclussion:

Had some issues to get all the data at once and the API request fails sometimes due to too many requests (no solution found ATM). The interval of the topchart makes the request amount too high, so that part of the excercise is not doable But with a little help from my friends [ðŸŽ¼](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCrlyX6XbTU) i succeeded!!
