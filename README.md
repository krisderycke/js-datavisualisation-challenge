# Data visualization
In this excercise i had to get all the data from an HTML table and use that data to present charts. Only using JavaScript and without editing the HTML. You can find my results [here](https://krisderycke.github.io/js-datavisualisation-challenge/).

## How did i do this?
First i searched the tables with the corresponding data and used several For-loops in order to get the proper data in Arrays.

## What have i learned?
Exctracting a ton of information using nothing but JavaScript Loops.

## Conclussion:

Had some issues to get all the data at once. But with a little help from my friends  [ðŸŽ¼](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCrlyX6XbTU) i succeeded!!
